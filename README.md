# Two-Dice Roller Project

Welcome to my first project where I built a simple two-dice roller using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I'm excited to share my journey of creating this fun and interactive dice game.

## Project Overview

This project consists of a web page that simulates the rolling of two dice. Each die is represented by an image, and when the user interacts with the page, the dice are rolled randomly, providing a visual representation of the outcome.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML:** The structure of the web page.
- **CSS:** Styling to make the dice visually appealing.
- **JavaScript:** The logic behind generating random dice rolls and updating the UI accordingly.
